### **A Simple Guide to Using GitHub Desktop for Absolute Beginners**

This guide will walk you through the basics of using GitHub Desktop, a user-friendly tool that makes it easy to manage your projects (called "repositories") on GitHub. By the end, you’ll know how to set up your environment, work with files, and share changes with others.

**Key Terms in Simple Words:**

- **Git:** A system that tracks changes in your files over time.  
- **GitHub:** A platform that stores your projects (repositories) online, so you can share and collaborate.  
- **Repository (Repo):** A “project folder” that holds your files and remembers their changes.  
- **Commit:** Saving a snapshot of your work. Think of it like clicking “Save” but also keeping a history of every change.  
- **Branch:** A separate “lane” in your project where you can safely work on new ideas without messing up the main code.  
- **Merge:** Combining changes from one branch into another.  
- **Pull Request (PR):** A proposal to merge your changes into someone else’s (or another branch’s) work, so it can be reviewed and approved.

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

#### **Step 1: Create a GitHub Account**
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and click **Sign up**.
2. Enter your username, email, and a password.
3. Verify your email by following the instructions GitHub sends you.

*At this point, you have a GitHub account ready to use.*

#### **Step 2: Install GitHub Desktop**
1. Go to the [GitHub Desktop Download Page](https://desktop.github.com/).
2. Download the version for your computer (Windows or macOS).
3. Install the app by following the on-screen instructions.
4. Open **GitHub Desktop** once the installation is done.

---

#### **Step 3: Sign In to GitHub Desktop**
1. When you open GitHub Desktop for the first time, it will ask you to **Sign in to GitHub**.
2. Enter the same username and password you just created.
   
*Now GitHub Desktop is connected to your GitHub account.*

---

#### **Step 4: Set Up Your Profile in GitHub Desktop**
1. In **GitHub Desktop**, go to **File** > **Options** (on Windows) or **GitHub Desktop** > **Preferences** (on macOS).
2. Enter your name and email address. Use the same email as your GitHub account for proper syncing.
3. These details will show up next to your commits, so your collaborators know who made which changes.

---

#### **Step 5: Cloning a Repository (Working with an Existing Project)**
“Cloning” means downloading a copy of an existing project from GitHub.com to your computer.

1. On GitHub.com, find the repository you want to work on. This could be your own or a public one.
2. In GitHub Desktop, click **File** > **Clone Repository**.
3. Select the repository from the list or paste its web address (URL).
4. Choose a folder on your computer where you want to keep it, and click **Clone**.

*You now have a local copy of that repository on your computer.*

---

#### **Step 6: Creating a New Repository (Starting Your Own Project)**
If you want to start a brand-new project on your computer and link it to GitHub:

1. In GitHub Desktop, click **File** > **New Repository**.
2. Give your repository a name (like “my-first-project”).
3. Choose where on your computer you’ll keep this project folder.
4. Click **Create Repository**.
5. (Optional) Add a **README.md** file, which is a place to describe your project.

*You’ve just created a new project folder managed by Git and GitHub.*

---

#### **Step 7: Making Changes and Committing Them**
To “commit” is to save a record of changes to your files.

1. Open your project folder on your computer (using File Explorer on Windows or Finder on macOS).
2. Edit or add files as you normally would.
3. Switch back to GitHub Desktop. Under the **Changes** tab, you’ll see a list of edited files.
4. Write a short **commit message** (e.g., “Added a new feature”).
5. Click **Commit to main** (or another branch if you’re using one).

*This saves a snapshot of your changes locally.*

---

#### **Step 8: Push Your Changes to GitHub**
“Pushing” means sending your local commits to GitHub.com so they’re available online.

1. After you commit, you’ll see a **Push origin** button at the top of GitHub Desktop.
2. Click it to upload your changes to GitHub.

*Now your changes are visible to anyone who visits your repository on GitHub.com.*

---

#### **Step 9: Pulling Changes from GitHub**
If someone else changes the project online, you can "pull" their updates to your computer.

1. In GitHub Desktop, go to **Repository** > **Pull**.
2. GitHub Desktop will download and apply changes made by others.

---

#### **Step 10: Working with Branches**
Branches let you work on new ideas without changing the main code. Think of them as “test areas” for new features.

1. In GitHub Desktop, go to **Branch** > **New Branch**.
2. Name your branch (e.g., “feature-login”).
3. Click **Create Branch**.
4. Make changes on this branch. To switch branches, use the **Branch** menu.

---

#### **Step 11: Merging Branches**
When you’re happy with the changes in your branch, you can merge them back into the main branch.

1. Switch to the **main** branch (or the branch you want to merge into).
2. In GitHub Desktop, go to **Branch** > **Merge into Current Branch**.
3. Select the branch you worked on and click **Merge**.

*All your branch changes are now part of the main code.*

---

#### **Step 12: Creating a Pull Request**
A Pull Request is a polite way to ask others to review and accept your changes.

1. Push your branch changes to GitHub.
2. On GitHub.com, you’ll see an option to **Compare & pull request** for your branch.
3. Click **Create Pull Request**, add a description, and submit it.

*Others can now review your work and decide if they want to merge it.*
